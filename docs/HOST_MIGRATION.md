# Host Migration

## Overview
Host migration system ensures game continuity when the current host disconnects by seamlessly transferring host responsibilities to another player.

## Migration Process

### 1. Host Disconnection Detection
- Connection timeout
- Graceful disconnection
- Connection quality monitoring

### 2. New Host Selection
```csharp
public class HostSelectionCriteria
{
    public float ConnectionQuality;
    public int Latency;
    public float UptimeSeconds;
    public bool IsReliableConnection;
}
```

### 3. State Transfer
- Game state preservation
- Authority transfer
- Connection re-establishment

### 4. Recovery Process
- State validation
- Reconnection handling
- Player synchronization

## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority System
1. Connection quality
2. Geographic location
3. System performance
4. Session duration

### Failure Handling
- Timeout management
- Fallback hosts
- State recovery
- Connection restoration

## Best Practices
- Regular state backups
- Multiple backup hosts
- Quick detection system
- Smooth transition handling
